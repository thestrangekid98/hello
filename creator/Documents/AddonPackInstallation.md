# Installing Add-Ons in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition

Add-Ons give you the ability to change the way things in your Minecraft world look and behave. Whether you create them yourself or get them from another creator, the next step will be activating them into a world where they can do their magic.

## Installing Add-On Instructions

Add-Ons can be installed on a variety of platforms running Minecraft. Here's how:

# [Windows 10 or Windows 11](#tab/Windows10)

1. First, you will need a Windows 10 or Windows 11 computer with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed.
1. Download the world or Add-On file from the provided source. If the file downloads as a .zip file, change the file extension name to ".mcworld" or ".mcpack".
1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
1. Open the file and the Add-On should open in Minecraft.

 - If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
 - If you're opening a .mcpack, a pop-up notification will alert you that you've successfully imported the pack. Depending on the pack type, this will then be available when editing worlds in either the Behavior Pack Tab or Resource Pack Tab.

# [Realms/Console](#tab/realms)

1. You will need a Windows 10 or Windows 11 computer with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition installed, a subscription to Realms, and Minecraft world with Add-Ons activated.
1. On the computer, launch Minecraft and upload the world with Add-Ons active to your Realm.
1. Go to your console, launch Minecraft, and open the Add-On enhanced world on the Realm.

# [Android](#tab/android)

1. Launch Minecraft.
1. Download the world or Add-On file to your Android device.
1. Go to the Settings app and select Storage > Explore (at the bottom). If you do not have a settings app, you can install a file explorer app like ES File Explorer.
1. Select the directory where you saved the file, usually "Download".
1. Select the file & the Add-On should open in Minecraft.

 - If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
 - If you're opening a .mcpack, a pop-up notification will alert you that you've successfully imported the pack. Depending on the pack type, this will then be available when editing worlds in either the Behavior Pack Tab or Resource Pack Tab.

# [iOS](#tab/iOS)

1. Launch Minecraft.
1. Click on the world or Add-On file you want to open (URL, e-mail attachment, etc.).
1. Your device will prompt you to open the file with Minecraft.
1. Click Open in "Minecraft". This will launch Minecraft with your selected file.

 - If you're opening a .mcworld that contains Add-Ons, the game will notify you that you've successfully imported the world. It will then be available from the "Play" menu.
 - If you're opening a .mcpack, a pop-up notification will alert you that you've successfully imported the pack. Depending on the pack type, this will then be available when editing worlds in either the Behavior Pack Tab or Resource Pack Tab.

# [Oculus Rift](#tab/oculusrift)

1. Open Minecraft for Windows 10 in Rift Mode (if not in Rift mode, Add-Ons will open the regular version of Minecraft for Windows 10).

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
