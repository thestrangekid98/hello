# Minecraft Maker Series Episode 1 - Making the Goblin Chef

![Maker Series](Media\MakerSeriesMakingTheGoblinChef\makerseries.jpg)

Introducing the Minecraft Maker Series! This series of videos is meant to be an inside look at how professional Minecraft creators make something cool from beginning to end. Instead of teaching the basics of creation tools, these videos will assume some base knowledge of creating in Minecraft, which lets us spend more time talking about creative decisions like color choice or finding the right proportions. The goal is to give you direct insight into how pros think while they are creating, and hopefully you can learn some tips and tricks along the way.

This first episode features Mojang 3D artist Peter Sheff, as he walks you through the creation of a custom Goblin Chef mob. Here, we will take you from the early concepting phase of the Chef all the way to it being ready to be placed inside of Minecraft. There are three parts to the episode: part 1 is modeling, part 2 is texturing, and part 3 is animating. To make sure we cover the whole creation process, these videos are 10-15 minutes each, so feel free to watch each part separately.

## Part 1: Modeling

In this video, Peter will start with the fundamentals of creating a new mob. The initial focus is using the 3D shape tools of Blockbench to focus on getting the 3D form of the Goblin Chef just right.

## Part 2: Texturing

Now that the basic shape of the mob has been determined, it's time to apply a set of colors and textures to the mob. Here, Peter focuses on establishing the process of designing your UV textures within Blockbench, including tips, tricks and shortcuts on using various tools within Blockbench.

## Part 3: Animating

In the animating section, you'll see how Peter animates the basic parts of the Goblin Chef, adding natural animations to the head, arms, and legs to create a walk cycle. You can see how to adjust the motion of various parts by adding keyframes in the Timeline tool of Blockbench.
