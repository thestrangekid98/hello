# Overview of a Mash-up Pack

Mash-ups are pre-built worlds that come with a resource pack and a skin pack. The resource pack is automatically applied to the mash-up world and can be added to any other world that you want to enhance.

Creators should consider making the mash-up into an export world. Make sure the inventory and your location at the time of export are what you intend for new players to have.
