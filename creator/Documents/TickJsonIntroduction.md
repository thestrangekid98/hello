# Introduction to tick.json

While command blocks are great for running a series of commands based on in-game events, Minecraft: Bedrock Edition offers the ability to use the in-game tick function to repeatedly run a series of functions by using a file called **tick.json**. `tick.json` is stored in the **functions** folder of a behavior pack next to the files containing the functions you want to run.

>[!Note]
>`tick.json` uses the gameplay tick which is 20 ticks per second, as opposed to the redstone tick which is 10 ticks per second.

>[!Important]
>  Unlike repeating command blocks, `tick.json` will execute commands before the world has fully loaded in. This might cause unintended behavior if you do not plan function usage carefully.
>  Be cautious not to run too many commands every tick, as it could affect performance, especially in low-end devices.

In this tutorial you will learn the following:

### Requirements

Itâ€™s recommended that the following be completed before beginning this tutorial:

- [Introduction To Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)
- [Introduction to Commands](CommandsIntroduction.md)
- [Introduction to Functions](FunctionsIntroduction.md)

You will also need the following:

- Your own behavior pack folder that already contains a `manifest.json` file.
- A Minecraft world with cheats enabled.

## Setting up the Functions Folder

The **tick.json** file contains the names of functions that you want to run every tick. Before creating `tick.json`, you will need to have functions for it to run. This example creates two function files to demonstrate how `tick.json` calls the files repeatedly.

1. If you don't already have one create a folder inside your behavior pack and name it **functions**. This folder should be on the same level as your `manifest.json` file.
1. Open the **functions** folder and create a text file.
1. Name the file **function_say_one.mcfunction**.
1. Open the file and enter `say one` on the first line.
1. Save the file.
1. Create another function file and name it **function_say_two.mcfunction**.
1. Open the file and enter `say two` on the first line.
1. Save the file.

Now there are two files for `tick.json` to call.

## Creating tick.json

The `tick.json` file contains a list of the functions that you want to execute on every tick of the game. You can also set the order that the functions will be called.

1. Inside the **functions** folder, create a text file and name it **tick.json**.
1. Copy the following text and paste it into your **tick.json** file. Save the file.

```json
 {
    "values": [
        "function_say_one", "function_say_two"
    ]
  }
```

The `tick.json` file uses only the `values` key, and the values are the names of the functions to run, without the .mcfunction extension.

## Testing the file

Launch Minecraft and activate the behavior pack.
When the world loads, there will be repeated messages displayed on the screen from **[Server]**.

>[!Note]
> `tick.json` files are additive and multiple will run if they exist in multiple behavior packs. For example, if the behavior pack stack has multiple behavior packs, all functions in `tick.json` will be run every tick.
